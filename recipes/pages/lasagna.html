    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is an Italian pasta dish featuring layers of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with sauces like ragù (meat sauce) or béchamel, vegetables, and cheeses such as ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan, all baked together until hot and bubbly.</p>
    <p>he dish is named after the very wide, flat sheets of pasta used to construct it, though the word can also refer to the final baked product.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the beef. Cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by one-third of the cooked ground beef, and one-third of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers two more times, ending with a layer of marinara sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the top layer of sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10-15 minutes before serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to cut into portions.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
