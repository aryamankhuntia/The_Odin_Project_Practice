    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper. Itâ€™s creamy, savory, and rich without the use of heavy cream.</p>
    <p>The heat of the pasta cooks the eggs gently, creating a silky sauce that clings to each strand of spaghetti.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 ounces pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until crispy. Stir in minced garlic for 1 minute, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Quickly add the hot drained spaghetti to the skillet with pancetta. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and immediately pour in the egg-cheese mixture, tossing quickly to prevent scrambling. Add reserved pasta water as needed to make a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning with extra salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra Parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
    </ol>
